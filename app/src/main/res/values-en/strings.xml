    <string name="tos_body">"By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should
        make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the
        app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code
        of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions.
        The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights
        related to it, still belong to SharpEye. SharpEye is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and
        efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its
        services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it
        very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. The SharpEye app stores and processes personal data that you
        have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to
        the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could
        make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and
        it could mean that the SharpEye app won’t work properly or at all. You should be aware that there are certain
        things that SharpEye will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have
        an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but
        SharpEye cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
        Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the app outside of an area with
        Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply.
        As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any
        such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
        country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using
        the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
        Along the same lines, SharpEye cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
        Service, SharpEye cannot accept responsibility. With respect to SharpEye’s responsibility for your use of the
        app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
        it available to you. SharpEye accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
        of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
        currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend
        the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using
        the app. SharpEye does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
        with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates
        to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
        at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a)
        the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete it from your device. Changes to This Terms and Conditions We may update our Terms and Conditions from
        time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any
        changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they
        are posted on this page. Contact Us If you have any questions or suggestions about our Terms and Conditions, do
        not hesitate to contact us at sharpeye.common@gmail.com. "
